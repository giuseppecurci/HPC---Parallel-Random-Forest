/**
 * @file metrics.h
 * @brief Header file defining metrics calculation functions.
 * 
 * This file provides the function for computing common classification metrics, 
 * such as accuracy, precision, and recall. The metrics are computed for each class and 
 * can be used for model evaluation.
 * 
 * The metrics are:
 * - Accuracy: Proportion of correctly predicted instances for each class.
 * - Precision: Proportion of correctly predicted positive instances for each class.
 * - Recall: Proportion of actual positive instances correctly identified for each class.
